                <p>Hello, My Name is Christian Mason and I am a Junior Cybersecurity major here at KSU. I have always been very interested in game and software development. During my time at KSU, I have added many skills, such as working in python and excel.</p>
                <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on several exciting projects that have pushed me to improve my technical skills. From learning about cyber threats and managing multiple demanding projects. Iâ€™ve expanded upon my knowledge in software development.</p>
                <p>My future goal is to leverage the skills and knowledge I gained at KSU to build a career in United States Army. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and love collaborating on projects that challenge me to think creatively.</p>
